If the user enters an invalid month, donâ€™t ask the user to enter the meter readings. Your program should
tell the user that the month was invalid and the program should not continue. If the month is valid, ask for
the current and previous readings. The readings cannot be negative numbers. Also the current reading has
to be the same or greater than the previous reading. If not, tell the user the readings are invalid and the
program should not continue. If the month and readings are ok, calculate the amount due.
