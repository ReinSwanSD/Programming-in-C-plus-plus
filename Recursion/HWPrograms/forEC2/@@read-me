  CS311 EC2 Files were given with your Homework files.

  There are 3 categories
  - Special/game
  - Graph (MST, Shortest, Cycle)
  - Plotting

  If you do all of them, you can get 50 pts.

  You should try doing at least one of these to
  test your readiness for future courses.

  You may NOT email them to me unless they work perfectly.
